## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students in colleges and universities face a common, frustrating cycle:

- **Doubts go unanswered** — Asking in large classes is intimidating, and teachers aren't available 24/7.
- **No structured Q&A** — WhatsApp groups are chaotic. Doubts get buried. Solutions are never archived.
- **Teachers lack visibility** — They have no data on which topics students are struggling with until exam results come in (too late).
- **Existing platforms miss the mark** — Stack Overflow is for professionals, not structured academics. ChatGPT has no classroom context.

**DoubtDesk bridges this gap** by combining AI-powered instant solving with real classroom structure — giving students answers in seconds and teachers insights in real-time.

## 💡 Solution

DoubtDesk provides a **virtual classroom** where:

1. **Students ask doubts** via text or image (photo of a handwritten problem).
2. **AI instantly solves** the doubt with step-by-step, simplified, and exam-ready explanations.
3. **Community & Teachers** can also answer, creating a layered support system.
4. **Analytics dashboard** identifies weak topics, peak doubt hours, and resolution rates — so teachers can act proactively.
5. **Moderation engine** keeps the platform academic and safe using AI content filtering.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 AI Doubt Solver
- Type a question or upload a photo — AI solves it instantly using Groq-accelerated LLMs.
- Structured output: Step-by-step → Simplified → Final Answer.
- Interactive follow-ups: click any step to ask "explain this more."
- Full LaTeX rendering for math and science equations (KaTeX).

### 🏫 Virtual Classrooms
- Teachers create classrooms with unique invite codes.
- Students join using invite codes; recommended classrooms auto-surface by university/year.
- Three doubt channels per class: **AI Solve**, **Community Board**, **Teacher Lane**.
- Role-based views (Student vs Teacher) with distinct capabilities.

### 📊 Classroom Analytics
- **Topic Difficulty Heatmap** — highlights which subjects have the most doubts.
- **Resolution Pulse** — solved vs. pending ratio with circular progress visualization.
- **Peak Activity Timeline** — 24-hour bar chart showing when students are most active.
- **Personal AI Mentor** — per-student weak-topic detection after sufficient engagement.

### 🛡️ Moderation & Safety
- AI-powered content moderation flags abusive, off-topic, or spam content.
- 3-strike system with escalating temporary account blocks.
- Full audit trail via moderation logs table.

### 🌐 Public Doubt Board
- Open community board (no classroom required) with subject filters.
- Like, reply, and mark doubts as solved.
